# Object-Oriented Programming Course Management Program

## Description
This program demonstrates the use of **objects and classes** in Python to model a **Course Management System**.  
Each course is represented as an object with attributes for:

- Course Code
- Number of Credits
- Enrollment Count
- Room Number

The program uses the `tabulate` library to neatly display the course information in a table format.

## Features
✅ Demonstrates **class creation and object instantiation**.  
✅ Uses **lists and loops** to handle multiple course objects.  
✅ Displays data in a **formatted table** using the `tabulate` library.  
✅ Provides a clear end-of-program message.

## How to Run
1. Install the required library if it's not already installed:
    ```
    pip install tabulate
    ```
2. Save the program code in a file called `course_management.py`.
3. Run the program using Python:
    ```
    python course_management.py
    ```

## Example Output
```
+--------------+---------+-------------+--------------+
| Course Code  | Credits | Enrollment  | Room Number  |
+--------------+---------+-------------+--------------+
| CS101        | 3       | 40          | Room 101     |
| MATH202      | 4       | 35          | Room 205     |
| PHY303       | 4       | 30          | Room 310     |
| ENG150       | 6       | 50          | Room 120     |

## About
This program was created to **practice and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python, including **class design, object instantiation, and encapsulation**. It also uses an external library (`tabulate`) to enhance data presentation.
